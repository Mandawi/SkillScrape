# Skillstract
A program to scrape indeed job listings to rank given skills in order of most needed. In addition, we are working on using machine learning clustering algorithms to cluster the data (i.e. communication skills, technical skills, etc.). We are also learning SQL to save the data because that will be more convenient than saving the data locally in text files.

Check out the Roman branch for latest, unstable version.
